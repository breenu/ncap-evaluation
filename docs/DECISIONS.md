## 2026-09-26: Phase 0 review (approved by Reenu)

**DEC-001: Primary satellite product is ACAG V5.GL.06.**
V5.GL.06 is documented on satpm.org (GWR method; van Donkelaar et al. 2021, Hammer et al. 2023), covers 1998–2024, and ships uncertainty grids. V6.GL.03 is also in `s3://satpmdata` for 1998–2024. However, neither the ACAG site nor the bucket has a methods note or README for it (checked 2026-09-26; files uploaded 2026-09-22). So V6.GL.03 is not the primary. Revisit if documentation appears. This replaces the proposal's V6.GL.02.04 / V5.GL.05.02 pairing.

**DEC-002: Satellite version comparison uses V6.GL.03, and V6.GL.02.04 is the vintage check.**
V6.GL.03 (CNN method) against V5.GL.06 (GWR method) tests dependence on the retrieval algorithm. V6.GL.02.04 (to 2023) against V6.GL.03 tests calibration vintage. Because each vintage is calibrated to a different set of ground monitors, this partly tests whether network growth leaks into the satellite product.

**DEC-003: ACAG files are downloaded as Asia-region files from the public AWS bucket `s3://satpmdata`.**
Access is anonymous and scriptable, and the S3 ETags serve as checksums. The Asia annual 0.01° files are about 18 MB (V5.GL.06) and 92 MB (V6) per year, against about 437 MB for a global monthly 0.01° file. The download covers 2005–2024; the analysis window is fixed in `analysis_plan.md`.

**DEC-004: Weather comes from ERA5 only.** Station cells use the CDS point time-series dataset (`reanalysis-era5-single-levels-timeseries`). The satellite layer uses ERA5 monthly means over an India bounding box.
The point dataset includes boundary-layer height, SSRD and total precipitation (checked against the CDS form on 2026-09-26) and never requires all-India hourly data. Open-Meteo's free tier is capped at 10,000 calls a day, so it is kept only as a no-key fallback.

**DEC-005: Ground measurements come from the OpenAQ S3 archive (`openaq-data-archive`). The v3 API is used only for station metadata.**
The API allows about 2,000 requests an hour, which is impractical for about 1,200 station-pollutant hourly series. India coverage is unverified, so a coverage probe runs before any bulk download (Phase 2 step 0). The CPCB CCR portal is the fallback.

**DEC-006: Boundaries and population come from GHSL UCDB R2024A. WorldPop is dropped.** GHS-POP is used only for a population-weighted sensitivity check.
UCDB already carries population by epoch, so a second population model would add inconsistency without adding information.

**DEC-007: GAMs are fitted with R `mgcv` only. pyGAM is dropped.**
mgcv selects smoothing by REML and is the reference implementation. pyGAM is weakly maintained.

**DEC-008: PDF extraction uses pdfplumber only. camelot is dropped.**
camelot needs Ghostscript on Windows, and one tool is enough.

**DEC-009: Orchestration uses Snakemake only (`snakemake --cores 8 all`). Make is dropped.**
Make is not native on Windows. Snakemake handles the file DAG, R steps and partial rebuilds.

**DEC-010: The fire covariate uses MODIS C6.1 FRP (2000+). VIIRS S-NPP (2012+) is a secondary check.**
VIIRS starts in January 2012, but the satellite panel's pre-period starts earlier, so a VIIRS-only covariate would leave pre-period years missing.

**DEC-011: The ground-data window is 2015-01-01 to 2026-03-31.**
NCAP targets are set by financial year, and FY2025-26 ended on 31 March 2026.

**DEC-012: The pre-registration gate is enforced in code through `config/gate.yaml` (`analysis_plan_approved: false`).**
Every rule that estimates post-2019 treatment effects checks the flag and refuses to run while it is false. This makes Hard Rule 4 mechanical. The flag is flipped only in a separate commit, after `docs/analysis_plan.md` is approved and committed.

**DEC-013: The minimum detectable effect is computed before the gate, by placebo-in-time on pre-2019 satellite data only.**
Rule 4 permits pre-2019 checks. Knowing the MDE lets the analysis plan state realistic decision rules.

**DEC-014: The environment is Miniforge (conda-forge) with Python 3.12 and R 4.4, pinned with conda-lock (win-64 and linux-64).** R is used only for mgcv, synthdid and did.
conda-forge is the reliable route for the geospatial stack on Windows, and system Python 3.14 is too new for parts of the scientific stack. `synthdid` is not on CRAN, so it is installed from a pinned GitHub commit.

**DEC-015: A GitHub Actions job runs pytest on synthetic fixtures only.**
It provides continuous evidence that the cleaning rules behave as specified, ahead of the Phase 10 clean-clone check. No real data is used in CI.

**DEC-016: The "reported change" in the decomposition uses all CAAQMS stations as reported. The official PRANA/NAMP PM10 series is not extracted.**
All-CAAQMS matches what public trackers such as CREA use. The official NCAP metric also draws on NAMP manual stations; it is recorded as a possible extension rather than core work.

**DEC-017: `docs/analysis_plan.md` is drafted during Phase 3 and formatted to the OSF pre-registration template.**
This lets Reenu's review overlap with the audit. The gate is unchanged: nothing estimates post-2019 effects until the plan is approved and committed.

**DEC-018: Maps use Survey-of-India-consistent boundaries (e.g. DataMeet).**
The audience is Indian policy, and official boundary depiction matters for credibility.

**DEC-019: API keys are never handled by Claude.** In Phase 2 Claude creates `~/.cdsapirc` and `.env` with placeholder values, and Reenu pastes the real keys.
This keeps secrets out of transcripts and git (Hard Rule 5).

**DEC-020: The GitHub repo (`breenu/ncap-evaluation`) stays private until after Phase 3.**
It is confirmed private as of 2026-09-26.

## 2026-09-26: Facts checked against sources (Hard Rule 2)

**DEC-021: Proposal facts that differ from, or were confirmed against, live sources.**
- ACAG: V6.GL.02.04 and V5.GL.05.02 exist and cover 1998–2023, as the proposal says. Newer V5.GL.06 and V6.GL.03 cover 1998–2024.
- NCAP city count: PIB (PRID 1989207) says 131 cities. The proposal's split of 49 XV-FC + 82 MoEFCC conflicts with other sources that give 48 XV-FC cities/UAs. This is to be reconciled from the source PDFs in Phase 2.
- The OpenAQ S3 archive is anonymous, organised by location and day, and hourly. Its India coverage is unverified.
- The NASA FIRMS country archive did not respond on 2026-09-26; to be re-tested in Phase 2.

## 2026-09-26: Phase 1 (skeleton)

**DEC-022: R is 4.5, not 4.4. `did`, `DRDID` and `fastglm` come from a dated CRAN snapshot, not conda-forge. Supersedes the R-version part of DEC-014.**
conda-forge's `r-did` cannot be installed with R ≥ 4.4: every recent build requires `r-drdid >= 1.1.0`, which conda-forge does not have, and its `r-drdid`/`r-fastglm` builds are stale. So conda-forge supplies R 4.5 and all of did's other dependencies. `workflow/scripts/install_r_extra.R` installs fastglm 0.1.2, DRDID 1.3.0 and did 2.5.1 from Posit Package Manager's 2026-09-25 CRAN snapshot (Windows binaries; source on Linux). It installs synthdid 0.0.9 from GitHub commit `70c1ce3` (2024-01-15). `tests/test_environment.py` proves these work, compiled code included: it runs `att_gt` on did's `mpdta` example and `synthdid_estimate` on the Prop 99 example.

**DEC-023: Each source's `data/raw/<source>/MANIFEST.csv` is committed to git. The raw files are not.**
Manifests are small provenance records (url, upstream id, date, sha256). Committing them lets a clean clone re-download and prove the bytes are identical. `src/common/manifest.py` refuses to overwrite raw files, to accept unrecorded files, or to accept a re-download whose hash differs.

**DEC-024: Undecided thresholds are `null` in `config/params.yaml`, not placeholder numbers.**
Examples are the flatline length, ceiling values, changepoint penalty, neighbour radius and spillover buffer. A placeholder could silently become the final value. `null` forces the stage that needs a threshold to set it, with a DECISIONS entry. `config/regions.yaml` is likewise a draft, to be finalised in Phase 3.

**DEC-025: The Snakemake workflow has a `pregate` target alongside `all`.**
`pregate` builds everything allowed before the analysis plan is approved (acquisition, audit, EDA, deweathering, composition, pre-period checks). `all` includes the gated causal and hierarchical stages, which stop with `GateClosedError` while the gate is shut (tested).

**DEC-026: Snakemake comes from bioconda (noarch `snakemake-minimal`) and pyfixest from PyPI.**
Neither is on conda-forge. Both are pinned in `conda-lock.yml`.

**DEC-027 (fact noted): `synthdid` supports only simultaneous adoption.**
Its DESCRIPTION says "methods only for the case that all treated units adopt treatment at the same time". This confirms the plan's approach of estimating SDID per adoption cohort and aggregating, with Callaway & Sant'Anna as the staggered-adoption check.

## 2026-09-26: Phase 2 step 0 (feasibility probe)

Numbers below are from `docs/data-probe.md`, which `python -m src.acquire.probe report` generates from `data/interim/probe/*.json`.

**DEC-028: The feasibility probe is scripted and its report is generated.**
`src/acquire/probe.py` has one subcommand per source (`acag`, `firms`, `openaq`, `cpcb_mirror`, `cds`) and writes JSON to `data/interim/probe/`, never to `data/raw/`. `report` renders `docs/data-probe.md`. This keeps the go/no-go evidence reproducible and stops hand-typed numbers.

**DEC-029: OpenAQ monthly coverage is measured with `/v3/sensors/{id}/days/monthly`, not `/hours/monthly`.**
`/hours/monthly` returned HTTP 408 (timeout) for sensors with a decade of history; `/days/monthly` answers in about 1 s. A month counts if any day has data. For the probe only, locations within 0.5 km are merged into one site, because OpenAQ lists one physical CPCB station under several location ids (e.g. Anand Vihar is 235, 5509 and 10487). Phase 3 replaces this with proper de-duplication rules.

**DEC-030 (fact): OpenAQ has almost no Indian CPCB data for 2023 and 2024, and no PM for 2015 in the API.**
The API and the S3 archive agree. Only 8 non-CPCB sites (AirNow, StateAir, Clean Air Catalyst) report in 2023–24; CPCB returns in 2025 with about 520 sites. The S3 archive has 22 location-months in 2015. In 2021–22 fewer than half of the site-months with any data have ≥75% of days. So OpenAQ cannot be the sole ground source (DEC-005 is not viable as written).

**DEC-031 (fact and judgement): CPCB's own data-repository endpoints return HTTP 404 (checked 2026-09-26). I did not reverse-engineer the new CCR web app.**
The `airquality.cpcb.gov.in/dataRepository/{all_india_stationlist,file_Path,download_file}` endpoints used by public scrapers until at least January 2026 now return an HTML "page not found". The CCR app is now an obfuscated JavaScript bundle. Reverse-engineering it would be fragile and is a decision for Reenu, not something to do unasked.

**DEC-032 (fact): a third-party mirror of CPCB's repository covers 2015–2025.**
`github.com/Vonter/india-cpcb-aqi` (ODbL 1.0; releases dated 2026-01-07) has yearly Parquet files of 15-minute CPCB station data, 4.12 GB for 2015–2025, with no 2026 file. The files are padded to every 15-minute slot, so the meaningful size measure is PM2.5 station-year equivalents: 374 (2023), 429 (2024). Its data dictionary labels timestamps as UTC. CPCB publishes IST, so this must be verified before use.

**DEC-033 (fact): the pre-2018 PM monitoring network is small in every source.**
PM2.5 station-year equivalents in the mirror are 16 (2015), 25 (2016), 35 (2017) and 95 (2018). OpenAQ has 31 and 41 PM2.5 sites in 2016 and 2017. This is the CAAQMS network's history, not a source defect. It limits the ground layer's pre-period (Layer B, RQ1 baselines) and does not affect Layer A.

**DEC-034 (fact): ACAG sizes and extent confirmed; V5.GL.06 was also uploaded on 2026-09-22.**
V5.GL.06, V6.GL.03 and V6.GL.02.04 Asia grids all contain India at 0.01°. 2005–2024 as planned is 4.68 GB in total (V6.GL.03 annual 1.84 GB, V6.GL.02.04 annual 1.73 GB). V5.GL.06 masks water; V6 fills it. The V5.GL.06 files carry the same 2026-09-22 bucket date as V6.GL.03, so that date does not show V6.GL.03 is newer. DEC-001 still stands on documentation grounds alone.

**DEC-035 (fact): the CDS ERA5 point time series works for our variables and window.**
A Delhi request (2015-01-01 to 2026-03-31, 7 variables) returned 98,592 hourly rows with no gaps or NaNs in a 3.1 MB zip. The CDS job took 37 s. The point snaps to the nearest 0.25° grid point (28.61, 77.21 → 28.50, 77.25). `ssrd` has tiny negative values (min −1.90 J/m²), to be clipped at zero in Phase 5.

**DEC-036 (fact): the FIRMS keyless country archive ends in 2024, and its MODIS processing version changes mid-series.**
MODIS India is available for 2000–2024 and VIIRS S-NPP for 2012–2024; 2025 and 2026 return 404. The MODIS `version` field is `6.2` for 2000–2017, `6.03` for 2018–2022 and `61.03` for 2023–2024. The 2018 switch falls just before NCAP, so a MODIS FRP covariate could carry a processing artefact at the treatment boundary. VIIRS is `2` throughout. To be resolved before FIRMS is used (cut item #4).
